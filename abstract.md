**Initial proposal:**

We hope to use regression to predict Californiaâ€™s electricity consumption over the next 50 years, particularly taking into account the state-wide switch to electric vehicles (EVs), as recent legislation was passed to ban the sale of conventional cars by 2035.

While the data behind the proposal shows that with the change to EVs will certainly decrease air pollution and petroleum consumption, which in turn mitigates CO2 emissions and prevents pollution-related health problems, how much of an increase in electricity demand will we see as a result? Knowing this could be helpful for planning infrastructure changes to meet that need with electricity generated by renewable resources. (Ex: projects like the TransWest Express which will bring wind/solar-powered electricity from Wyoming to California?)

**Updated proposal:**
I hope to identify a relation between the number of registered cars over the last 10 years based on fuel source (electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid vehicles, gasoline-powered vehicles...), electricity demand, and carbon emissions in California. Using this, we predict what carbon emissions in California would look like with different values of registered types of cars--on one extreme, what if all cars in California were EVs? What would carbon emissions look like with increased electricity consumption but decreased direct emissions from gasoline-fueled vehicles?
