**Initial proposal:**

We hope to use regression to predict Californiaâ€™s electricity consumption over the next 50 years, particularly taking into account the state-wide switch to electric vehicles (EVs), as recent legislation was passed to ban the sale of conventional cars by 2035.

While the data behind the proposal shows that with the change to EVs will certainly decrease air pollution and petroleum consumption, which in turn mitigates CO2 emissions and prevents pollution-related health problems, how much of an increase in electricity demand will we see as a result? Knowing this could be helpful for planning infrastructure changes to meet that need with electricity generated by renewable resources. (Ex: projects like the TransWest Express which will bring wind/solar-powered electricity from Wyoming to California?)

**Final abstract:**
In 2022, California announced its intention to move towards making all new car sales zero-emissions vehicles by 2035, a trend more common in European countries but the first of its scale in the United States. We hope to understand the impact that electric vehicles will have on electricity demand and by consequence on the state's carbon emissions. In this project, we use a simple approach for projecting numbers of registered cars by fuel type (gasoline, electric, plug-in hybrid electric...) in the near future based on current growth trends with more or less optimism for EV growth. Using these distributions, we study stacking linear regressors with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting regressors for predicting monthly electricity demand and its associated carbon emissions through energy generation.
