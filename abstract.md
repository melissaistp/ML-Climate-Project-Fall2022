Initial proposal:

We hope to use regression to predict Californiaâ€™s electricity consumption over the next 50 years, particularly taking into account the state-wide switch to electric vehicles (EVs), as recent legislation was passed to ban the sale of conventional cars by 2035.

While the data behind the proposal shows that with the change to EVs will certainly decrease air pollution and petroleum consumption, which in turn mitigates CO2 emissions and prevents pollution-related health problems, how much of an increase in electricity demand will we see as a result? Knowing this could be helpful for planning infrastructure changes to meet that need with electricity generated by renewable resources. (Ex: projects like the TransWest Express which will bring wind/solar-powered electricity from Wyoming to California?)
